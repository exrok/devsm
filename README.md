# devsm: The TUI Development Service Manager

devsm manages your services during development workflows optimized to keep
you in the zone even when:
- switching between developing numerous services,
- executed test at various levels,
- switching between profiles and git branches.

devsm does thus by providing powerful TUI for managing actions and services you would
do during development and getting feedback quickly with aggregated log views with
powerful filtering. 

The `devsm.toml` tersely defines all the actions, services and test for your workspace
along with dependencies between them.
